# Final project for CS246 (Object-Oriented Software Development) in the Winter 2025 term
# By Len Dizdar and Rylan Hachey
# 
# This game generally follows the rules of Klaus Teuber's Settlers of Catan,
# while changing a few things for flavour and omitting the following:
#   Development cards, longest road, bank/port trading
#
# Building Resources:
#   A basement costs one BRICK, one ENERGY, one GLASS, and one WIFI to build.
#   A house costs two GLASS, and three HEAT to build.
#   A tower costs three BRICK, two ENERGY, two GLASS, one WIFI, and two HEAT to build.
#   A road costs one HEAT and one WIFI to build.
#
# Victory points:
#   Basement: 1
#   House: 2
#   Tower: 3
#   (These are the only methods of obtaining victory points)
#
# Other than that, the rules are as close as possible to Settlers of Catan.
#
# The console output will suggest what commands to use.
# Note that prompts like <vertex>, <tile, or <edge> require a number (as displayed on the board).
